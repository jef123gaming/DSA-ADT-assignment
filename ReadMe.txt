=====================================================================================================


Project Description:
--------------------
This clinic management system implements several custom Abstract Data Types (ADT) 
without using Java built-in Collections Framework. This system demonstrates how the
custom ADTs are implemented and applied in its features and functionalities.


How to Run:
-----------
1. Open the project in NetBeans (or any Java IDE).
2. Build the project.
3. Run "ClinicSystemManager.java" that sits inside the "control" folder to launch the
main menu, from which users can access the sub-menus of the 5 subsystems namely Patient
Management, Consultation Management, Doctor Management, Medical Treatment Management and
Pharmacy Management modules.
